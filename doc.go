/*
Package ssh1 implements an SSHv1 client.

SSH is a transport security protocol, an authentication protocol and a
family of application protocols. The most typical application level
protocol is a remote shell and this is specifically implemented.  However,
the multiplexed nature of SSH is exposed to users that wish to support
others.
